# RR-CANMAN-CCN01
This is an effort to reverse engineer the CANMAN CCN01 eeprom, the goal is to create a working bin file for a reset module specifically for the Port side Jet installed in M/Y Sunglider

CANMAN ID21(working dump).bin is the EEPROM dump of the CCN01 module with node id of 21 and node name of PO-Master

CANMAN ID25(working dump).bin is the EEPROM dump of the CCN01 module with node id of 25 and node name of CT-Master

CANMAN CCN01 RESTORED BLANK.bin is the EEPROM dump generated from blank EEPROM installed on CCN01 board and powered up with the Restore dip switch switched on.

Here's a nice reference for this project: http://www.es.mdh.se/pdf_publications/486.pdf a masters thesis of Mr. Anders Möller of Mälardalen University, Sweden
